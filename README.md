# Quizzer-Batch
A Jeopardy-esque game made with only batch files!

The current version is 1.0.2. Everything should be stable after roughly eight hours of scripting and testing, but if you run into any bugs, please reach out. I will give you credit if you successfully squish a bug and/or provide code that I use in the game.
The patches are stable. 

Code optimization, better CUI, more questions, saving progress and statistics, and advanced game modes will be implemented in the next versions. Suggestions are always welcome.
