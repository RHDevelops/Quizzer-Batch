# Quizzer-Batch
A Jeopardy-esque game made with only batch files!

The current version is 1.0. Everything is stable after roughly eight hours of scripting and testing, but if you run into any bugs, please reach out. I will give you credit if you successfully squish a bug and/or provide code that I use in the game.

Code optimization, better CUI, more questions, saving progress and statistics, and advanced game modes will be implemented in the next versions. Suggestions are always welcome.

## 1.0 ##
* This is the current release.
* Users can create their own subjects and questions.
* Players may choose five subjects, including repeats, to play with.
* Includes one pack of six questions related to World War II to test out the gameplay (use WW2-Builtin as a subject).
